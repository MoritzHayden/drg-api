    "Hoxxes IV is a scorched, tidally-locked planet orbiting the blue star Creus, its extraordinarily rich precious material deposits and extremely hostile environment.",
    "Bismor might be named for bismuth, a metal that is usually obtained as a byproduct of refining lead or tin.",
    "Several of Bismor's call out voice lines are a subtle gag in reference to the fact that Bismor was for the longest time the only crafting mineral to lack call out voice lines.",

    "Red Sugar has addictive qualities, as noted by the Dwarves, though this has no bearing on gameplay.",

    "The internal name for Point Extraction mission is still \"Motherlode\", which is original name of the very first iteration of this mission type.",

    "The \"Dance Moves\" statistic is purely cosmetic; while there are six different animations that the Hologram can play, none of them are any better or worse at attracting enemies.",

    "The \"Bulldog\" Heavy Revolver model is completely static, the hammer and cylinder do not move at all even when firing.",
    "When the 7 in \"BRT7\" is interpreted as a second T, it can be read as \"BRTT\". This is an onomatopoeia of the weapon's firing sound.",
    "The Tactical Leadburster has five barrels to shoot out from. It is unknown how it fit that much bullets within such a small profile.",

    "The name of Zhukov NUK17 is likely a reference to Georgy Zhukov, a Soviet general during World War 2. The word \"zhuk\" or \"жук\" in russian translates to \"bug\", which could make sense in the context of the game.",
